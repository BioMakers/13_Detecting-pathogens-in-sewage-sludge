## Detecting Pathogens in Sewage Sludge

## Synopsis

CDI’s piloted sewage system uniquely aims to be a sustainable and profitable system where products derived from sewage can be sold back into the community at prices that can compete with the current market.
The present state of the 2016 piloted sewage system is that there is a flow of sewage, albeit with unpredictable biogas and fertiliser production, the device for which is still in prototyping stages. Further understanding of the sewage system is needed to diagnose problems and measure the effectiveness of designs.
The solar concentrator aims to ‘cook away’ harmful pathogens in the sewage for conversion into marketable fertiliser. The cooking process is measured by taking infrared thermal readings of the outside of the drum container. However, there is a need to monitor the environmental conditions within the drum and test the resulting sludge for pathogens.
We are looking to create a product that can rapidly report on the fertilizing quality and safety of heat-treated sewage sludge.

## Software

Explain functionality of software components (if any) as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out how your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Ideally, this should be pseudo code or an abstract graphical representation of your code e.g entity relationship diagram. Consider adding a screenshot of your User Interface.

## Hardware

Explain how the hardware components (if any) of your project function as concisely as possible, including a short description of fabrication and assembly. Component suppliers and part numbers should be provided separately in a bill of materials, in a 'Hardware Folder'.

## Installation, Maintenance and Testing Guide

Provide instructions on usage, describe a test scheme and show how to run the tests with code and hardware configuration examples with some representative results.
